# ADR-001: Use Node.js + Plain JavaScript for Metadata Processor

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Context

LinkStash needs a processor that:
- Reads URLs from `input.txt`
- Fetches metadata from each URL
- Handles Twitter links specially via fxtwitter API
- Appends to `links.json`
- Clears the input file

We need to choose a runtime/language for this processor script.

## Decision

Use **Node.js** for the processor, written in plain JavaScript. Keep it as a single executable script (`process.js`) with no build step.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Python**: Would work, but adds dependency outside the Node.js ecosystem
2. **Bash + curl**: Too fragile for parsing HTML and JSON reliably
3. **Deno/Bun**: Overkill; Node.js is already available and stable

## Consequences

- ✅ Processor runs with `node process.js` — easy to invoke from shell
- ✅ Reuses npm ecosystem for HTTP client (`node-fetch`/`axios`)
- ✅ Same ecosystem as the frontend (easier maintenance)
- ✅ No build step needed
- ❌ Slightly larger dependency footprint than minimal bash
- ❌ Requires Node.js to be installed on the user's machine

## Notes

The processor will run locally (not in a serverless function). GitHub Actions can invoke it if auto-deployment is desired later.
