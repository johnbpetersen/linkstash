# ADR-004: Client-Side Search — No Backend Required

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Context

LinkStash needs keyword search across ~1000 links. We must decide whether to implement search server-side or client-side.

## Decision

**Client-side search only** — No backend required.

Frontend loads `links.json` at startup, then filters in JavaScript using simple substring/includes match.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Server-side search**: Would require hosting, adds complexity, overkill for ~1000 items
2. **Full-text search engine (Elasticsearch, Algolia)**: Massive overengineering
3. **Client-side only**: (CHOSEN) Simple, fast, zero hosting cost

## Consequences

- ✅ Zero backend infrastructure needed
- ✅ Instant search (no network latency)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Supports deployment to static hosting (GitHub Pages)
- ❌ Search must load all links into memory
- ❌ Performance degradation at 10,000+ items (but acceptable for spec scope)
- ❌ No advanced search features (yet)

## Performance Assumptions

- links.json with 1000 items ≈ 500KB-1MB uncompressed
- JavaScript filter() on 1000 items ≈ <10ms (imperceptible to user)
- At 10,000 items, still should be <100ms (acceptable for v1)

## Notes

If performance becomes an issue in future, could:
- Implement server-side search (Node.js backend)
- Use a search library like `lunr.js` or `fuse.js` for fuzzy/better matching
- Add incremental search (only index visible items)
- But: start simple, optimize only when needed.
