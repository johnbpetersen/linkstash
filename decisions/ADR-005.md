# ADR-005: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS Frontend — No Framework

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Context

LinkStash frontend is a single HTML page that:
- Loads links from `links.json`
- Displays them as cards
- Provides real-time search filtering
- Sorts newest first

We must choose a frontend approach.

## Decision

**Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript** — No framework (no React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).

Single `index.html` file with embedded CSS and JavaScript. Loads `links.json` via fetch.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **React/Vue/Svelte**: Framework overhead not justified for single-page, no state management
2. **Static site generator (Hugo, Jekyll)**: Overkill; dynamic search requires JS anyway
3. **Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS**: (CHOSEN) Simplest, fastest load time, zero build step

## Consequences

- ✅ Single file deploy (easy to host anywhere)
- ✅ Zero build step, fast local development
- ✅ Minimal JavaScript (easy to understand, maintain, audit)
- ✅ Fast initial load (no framework download)
- ✅ Works on all browsers (no transpilation needed)
- ❌ No component reusability (but not needed for single page)
- ❌ Will require careful DOM manipulation (manageable for search + sort)

## Notes

JavaScript will be minimal:
- Load links.json via fetch
- Render cards as HTML
- Filter on search input change
- No state management library needed
- No package bundler needed

If complexity grows in future (multiple pages, complex UI), can upgrade to a framework then.
